# 8-Puzzle Solver

By Luke Matsunaga

Project completed as part of an algorithms course. 
Focus: Implementing search algorithms for solving the 8-puzzle.

This project implements an 8-puzzle solver in C++ using classical AI search techniques:

- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Misplaced Tile Heuristic (A*)
- Manhattan Distance Heuristic (A*)
  
## Prerequisites
- C++17 compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (version 3.15+)
- Ninja (optional, recommended for fast builds)

## Features
- Predefined puzzles of varying difficulty  
- Custom puzzle input with validation  
- Performance metrics:
  - Nodes expanded  
  - Maximum queue size  
- Comparison of search strategies and heuristics  
- Modular and readable C++ implementation  

## Concepts Covered
- State-space representation  
- Informed vs uninformed search  
- Heuristic design and evaluation  
- Optimal pathfinding and cost analysis  

## Building the Project
1. Clone the repo (if you haven't already)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ActualCookie88/IntroToAIProjects.git
```
2. Navigate to folder and create a build directory
```bash
cd 8_Puzzle_Solver/
mkdir build
cd build
```
3. Configure CMake to use Ninja
```bash
cmake -G Ninja ..
```
This generates all build files inside the build/ directory.

4. Build the project
```bash
ninja
```

## Running the Program
```bash
./puzzle        # On Linux/macOS
puzzle.exe      # On Windows
```

## Output
This program displays:

- Solution path from initial state to goal  
- Total number of moves (solution cost)  
- Number of nodes expanded during the search  
- Maximum queue size reached
